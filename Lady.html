    <h3>About Her</h3>
    <p>Lady is a fluffy and playful Cockapoo who loves to snuggle and bring joy to everyone around her. She's always up for a game of fetch or a chill cozy night in on the couch.</p>

    <h3>Lady's Favorite Tricks</h3>
    <h4>Sit</h4>
    <p>Lady loves to show off her "sit" command, specially if a treat is involved. </p>
    
    <h4>Shake</h4>
    <p>One of the first tricks Lady learned was to shake! If you hold out the palm of your hand to her and ask her to shake she puts up her little paw to your hand.</p>

    <h4>Fetch</h4>
    <p>Fetch is one of Lady's top three favorite things to do. If it was up to her she could play all day with her "chuck it" ball.</p>
